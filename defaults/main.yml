# The main setting that needs adjustment is the max number of open files, also known as ulimit -n.
# The default value on many operating systems is too low for a messaging broker (eg. 1024 on several Linux distributions).
# We recommend allowing for at least 65536 file descriptors for user rabbitmq in production environments.
# 4096 should be sufficient for most development workloads
